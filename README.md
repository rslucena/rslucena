### Hi there 👋

My name is Rodrigo Lucena from Brazil (🇧🇷). 

Other projects: [CheckHouse](https://www.checkhousevistoria.com.br/)

Ongoing open source projects [Docker-Template](https://github.com/rslucena/Docker-Template)

I really like what I do, both in the Front-End and Back-End.

In my free time I like to play online (FPS, Strategy), watch movies(🎞️),  series (📺), to read books (📚). I can not live without music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life (🤯)
