# Rodrigo Lucena üáßüá∑

My name is **Rodrigo Lucena**, I'm from Brazil.

I‚Äôm a **Backend Software Engineer** and **Technical Leader** with over 15 years of experience in designing, developing, and scaling complex, high-performance systems. I hold a **Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science** from *Faculdade Anhanguera* and I'm currently pursuing a **postgraduate degree in Strategic Software Engineering Management** at the *Universidad Europea del Atl√°ntico*.

I'm highly skilled in backend development with strong proficiency in [**PHP**](https://github.com/php), [**TypeScript**](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), and modern frameworks like [**Workerman**](https://github.com/walkor/workerman) and [**Swoole**](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src). I have solid experience working across multiple runtimes including [**Node.js**](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [**Bun**](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun), and [**Deno**](https://github.com/denoland/deno).

My expertise includes **monolithic**, **microservices**, **pub/sub**, and **self-managed monorepo architectures**. I'm proficient in high-performance messaging systems like [**RabbitMQ**](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server) and [**NATS**](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server).

I work comfortably with both SQL and NoSQL databases, including [**MySQL**](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server), [**PostgreSQL**](https://github.com/postgres/postgres), and [**MongoDB**](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo), as well as serverless and cloud-oriented solutions like [**Turso (SQLite)**](https://github.com/libsql/libsql) and [**PlanetScale (MySQL)**](https://github.com/planetscale).

I'm experienced in building and integrating with **RESTful APIs**, **Sockets**, **WebSockets**, and **Streams**, especially for handling large-scale real-time data ‚Äî with a strong focus on stock and cryptocurrency markets.

Currently, I lead and develop the backend of an **automated trading execution platform**, which processes buy/sell recommendations across global markets (NYSE, NASDAQ, NSE, BSE, B3, and Forex), bridging users, financial complexity, and brokers in real time.
