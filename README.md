### Hi there 👋

My name is Rodrigo Lucena from Brazil (🇧🇷). 

I have been working with Back-End and Front-End development for over 10 years and am currently a technical leader at [Sonartrade](https://sonartrade.com.br), being responsible for the entire team, Back-end and its project structure.

I am also working at [Academia do Psicologo](http://academiadopsicologo.com.br/), with design, programming and development [psico.club](https://psico.club/). 

I really like what I do, both in the Front-End and Back-End.

In my free time I like to play online (FPS, Strategy), watch movies(🎞️),  series (📺), to read books (📚). I can not live without music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life (🤯)
