My name is Rodrigo Lucena from Brazil (🇧🇷). 

I have been working with Back-End and Front-End development for over 15 years and am currently a technical leader at [Sonartrade](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=sonartrade&c=apps&hl=pt_BR&gl=US), [Chamleo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chamleo.ch&hl=pt_BR&gl=US), being responsible for the entire team, Back-end and its project structure.

Templates:

- ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-3178C6?logo=typescript&logoColor=white) Minimalistic project template to jump start a Node. [show me.](https://github.com/rslucena/Template-Typescript)

- ![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PHP-3178C6?logo=php&logoColor=white) A simple structure used as a basis for creating new projects. The main idea is to have a quick project start and evolve as needed. [show me.](https://github.com/rslucena/Docker-Template-PHP)

I really like what I do, both in the Front-End and Back-End.

In my free time I like to play online (FPS, Strategy), watch movies(🎞️),  series (📺), to read books (📚). I can not live without music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life (🤯)

Long live PHP ⚡ ❤️
